                          I was born in Sana'a, Yemen. I grew up there until I was 18.
                          Driven by the necessity for change, the well to face new challenges,
                          my curiosity to get to know new cultures & people
                          and the need to discover the world, I decided to learn german and travel to
                          Germany to discover the possibilities.

                      <div class="aboutMe__sectionInfo">
                      At the beginning of my journey I ended up starting my college in the university of Saaland,
                      where I had to finish Physics, Chemistry, Maths in the german language. I stayed there for
                      around 18 Months and afterwards I decided to keep widening my horizon and travelled to Berlin
                      after getting an acceptance to study Industrial Engineering and Management in the TU-Berlin.</div>

                      <div class="aboutMe__sectionInfo">
                          After moving to Berlin, I instantly recognized it's multiculturalism, diversity and
                          beauty and I knew this is the place I should be at to find myself, self-develop,
                          and build my own business one day :).

                      <div class="aboutMe__sectionInfo">
                          After finishing my college in the University of Saarland, I applied for a place
                          in the TU-Berlin for Industrial Engineering & Management.
                          There I had subjects like: Statistics, Linear Algebra, Analysis,
                          Marketing & Production Management, Innovation and Organisation Management,
                          Mechanics, etc. After a while there I felt that most of the things
                          we learn there and keep solving are actually already hard-coded into programs,
                          where one only needs to know how those programs work to make all kinds of
                          calculations to reach to any intended result. From there on, I knew that
                          coding is the future, and one day it will also have to be tought in schools,
                          because it just makes life easier. While I was working in d/f companies I noticed everyone
                          was using Programs and Apps to make all the calculations needed and from there
                          on I recognized the importance of being able to create these kind of instruments
                          to utilize the knowledge one has to make a difference.
                          <br><br>
                          From there on my journey in the HTW-Berlin began. Fascinated by the infinite spectrum
                          of computer science, I felt for the first time that I indeed found myself studying the right
                          major and I knew I can make anything with the knowledge I am gaining during this new journey.

                          During my studies I had to work to keep financing myself. My strong english helped me big time
                          to find different kind of jobs in call centers. By the beginning of it I worked with Sykes
                          and there it was necessary to keep a friendly tone all the time and try my best to keep my cool
                          no matter how the situation escalated. Besides that, we had to offer solutions and give our best to
                          keep the customer satisfied.
                          <br><br>Afterwards, I worked at Bosch Service Solutions for around 1
                          whole year, where I had to speak with customers in Arabic, English, and German. I worked with
                          with at least 6 others nationalities, where we had to cover England,
                          France, Germany, Poland, Switzerland, Turkey and UAE.

                          During this work I acquired better communication skills and work under high stress levels.

                            Now, as I started my Computer Science studies, I wanted also to start
                            working something which is somehow relevant to my studies. Therefore,
                          I started applying and got my first Job with BMG Rights and Management
                          as First Level Support. There I learned so many things about Networking,
                          problem solving, and communication, hence I had to stay in constant contact
                          with my colleagues in case they need any kind of support.
                          We didn't only cover Berlin, we were also responsible for Brazil,
                          Netherlands, Sweden, Spain, UK and the USA. We overtook tasks like
                          system and programs deployment. ...

                          Currently, I am working also an IT at Innocean Worldwide Europe GmbH.
                          However, hence my passion & most motivation lies in becoming a very good programmer
                          in the future, I started visiting so many courses besides the courses I already finished
                          in my university. I am now applying to start developing all kinds of things.
                          My goal after master web-development is to also start to develop apps for me to
                          be able to make any idea into reality as soon as it
